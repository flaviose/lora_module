# Reference Implementation 3: Geolocation example application

## Hardware
### MCU Board
- Nucleo L476RG board ( with STM32L476RGT6 MCU)

### Radio Boards
- lr1110 (EVK board)
- lr1120 (EVK board)

## Description

This example illustrates how a typical application running LoRa Basics Modem (LBM) can benefit from the geolocation services to perform GNSS and Wi-Fi scans and send it either with direct uplinks, or using the Store & Forward service.

This example demonstrates:
- how to configure LoRa Basics Modem library
- how to start the needed services (almanac demodulation update for GNSS scan, store & forward, ...)
- how to program GNSS/Wi-Fi scans
- how to get events from the services to sequence the geolocation scans

## Geolocation services

This example application relies on various services provided by LoRa Basics Modem to simplify the usage of a LR11xx radio to perform geolocation based on GNSS and Wi-Fi scans.

The services used are:
* GNSS scan & send
* GNSS almanac demodulation
* Wi-Fi scan & send
* Store & Forward

For more details about the GNSS and Wi-Fi services, please refer to the documentation here:

[Geolocation services documentation](<../../lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/geolocation_services/README.md>)

## LoRa Basics Modem configuration

Once the modem has reset, the application configures the various services used and initiate both GNSS and Wi-Fi scans. Then, it completely relies on LBM arbitration to handle LR11xx radio access.

In this example, the device does not need to successfully join a LoRaWAN network to start scanning.
If "Store & Forward" is enabled the scan results are stored in the device's flash memory, and forwarded later once the device has joined a network. Otherwise, the scan results are lost.

Once the modem has joined the LoRaWAN network, the application configures the ADR custom profile.
It is necessary to use a custom profile due to payload size constraints.

## Geolocation services events

After the initial scan has been initiated, the application has to rely on the events sent by the GNSS/Wi-Fi services to get results and program the next scan.

The events to be handled are the following:
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_SCAN_DONE: the GNSS scan service has completed the multiframe scan sequence. The application can retrieve the associated data.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_TERMINATED: the GNSS send service has completed the multiframe send sequence according to the selected send mode (direct uplink, store & forward, bypass...). The application must wait for this event before programming the next GNSS scan.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_ALMANAC_DEMOD_UPDATE: the GNSS almanac demodulation service has progressed. This event is for information, there is no action to take from the application.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_WIFI_SCAN_DONE: the Wi-Fi scan service has completed the scan. The application can retrieve the associated data.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_WIFI_TERMINATED: the Wi-Fi send service has completed the send sequence according to the selected send mode (direct uplink, store & forward, bypass...). The application must wait for this event before programming the next Wi-Fi scan.

## Configuration

### LoRaWAN related configuration

The `example_options.h` header file defines several constants to configure the LoRaWAN parameters (region, keys).

* MODEM_EXAMPLE_REGION: Selects the regulatory region. This example has been tested for SMTC_MODEM_REGION_EU_868.
* USER_LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI: LoRaWAN device EUI for user defined credentials.
* USER_LORAWAN_JOIN_EUI: LoRaWAN Join EUI for user defined credentials.
* USER_LORAWAN_APP_KEY: LoRaWAN App Key for user defined credentials.

The custom ADR profile parameters are defined in the `main_geolocation.c` file.

* CUSTOM_NB_TRANS: The number of retransmission to be done for each LoRaWAN uplink
* ADR_CUSTOM_LIST: The custom datarate distribution to be used for LoRaWAN uplink

Those parameters have to be carefully defined depending of the region of operation, the scan period, the payload size etc...

### Geolocation demonstration related configuration

* GEOLOCATION_GNSS_SCAN_PERIOD_S: Defines the duration between the end of a GNSS scan & send sequence and the start of next sequence, in seconds.
* GEOLOCATION_WIFI_SCAN_PERIOD_S: Defines the duration between the end of a Wi-Fi scan & send sequence and the start of next sequence, in seconds.
* By default, the selected GNSS scan mode is SMTC_MODEM_GNSS_MODE_MOBILE, and the GNSS send mode is SMTC_MODEM_SEND_MODE_STORE_AND_FORWARD.
* By default, the selected WiFi send mode is SMTC_MODEM_SEND_MODE_UPLINK.

## Build

The example can be built through GNU make command by doing the following:

```shell
$ make full_lr1110
```

By default, the demonstration is compiled to use the EUIs and Application key defined in the file `example_options.h` file.

All the default compilation options used are available in the `app_makefiles/app_options.mk` file.

## Usage

### Serial console

The application requires no user intervention after the static configuration
option have been set.

Information messages are displayed on the serial console, starting with the
DevEUI, AppEUI/JoinEUI and PIN that you might need in order to register your
device with the LoRa Cloud Device Join service.

### LoRaWAN Network Server / Application Server

This application needs an Application Server to run in order to perform the GNSS and Wi-Fi solving.

Two possibilities:
* Use a custom LoRaWAN application server which just forwards incoming uplink to LoRaCloud.
* Use the LoRaCloud Locator https://atk.loracloud.com/ which embeds a complete integration of an application server and an associated dashboard.
